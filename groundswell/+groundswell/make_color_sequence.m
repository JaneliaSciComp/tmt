function color_sequence = make_color_sequence()

% this creates a sequence of colors to be used for traces
% the sequence is specified in the HSV colorspace
% all traces have the same satuaration and brightness
% the hue sequence is determined by taking 256 evenly spaced samples
%   from 0 to 1, and then shuffling them in such a way that each
%   hue gets mapped to the 'bit-reversed' hue.
% This means that subsequent colors tend to be far apart in hue, 
%   which is the desired effect.
